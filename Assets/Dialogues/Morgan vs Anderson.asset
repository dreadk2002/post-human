    text: With us is presumtive Presidential nominee, Senator Morgan, for his first
      major interview since sweeping the Super Tuesday primary contests less than
      twenty-four hours ago. Congratulations on your victories, Senator and for locking
      down the nomination so quickly.

    text: Now that your opponents have suspended their campaigns, are you surprised
      at all with how quickly you've managed to dispatch your competition? You were,
      after all, facing two candidates that were far better funded than yourself
      throughout most of the early primary season. Yet here we are in the middle
      of March, and you're already uncontested and headed for the general election.
